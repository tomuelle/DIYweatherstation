# DIYweatherstation

Some arduino codes developped for the SODAQ mbili and Seeeduino stalkers v3.1 boards in order to create a low-cost automatic weather station. The current files only connect one MS5803-14BA sensor to the board but other sensors could be added with minor modifications.

I also added a file where I connect a BME280 and a Davis rain gauge to an mbili board with a LoRa antenna.
