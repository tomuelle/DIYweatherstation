This folder provides different low-cost arduino based automatic datalogger solutions developed in the framework of my PhD work in a remote high alpine environment. 

While the most simple <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/arduinoBoardUno">Arduino UNO</a> board only provides basic function to power low-power sensors, a large range of development boards were specifically developed to provide simple hardware solutions to develop low-cost dataloggers.
The main features of these boards are :
<ul>
  <li>The basic functions of an adruino boards (Microcontroller,digital, analog and I2C pins); </li>
  <li>A low-power consumption; </li>
  <li>A real-time clock (RTC) clock to record time and to allow an RTC external interrupts to wake up the board from deep sleep;</li>
  <li>A build-in connector for 3.7V LiPo battery;</li>
  <li>A build-in connector for 5V solar pannel with a charge controller;</li>
  <li>A build-in LoRa module or a socket to add a LoRa module with antenna;</li>
  <li>A SD Card holder to save data locally.</li>
</ul>
